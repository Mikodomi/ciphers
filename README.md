# Ciphers
A basic implementation of the most famous classical ciphers in the C programming language. In the future I plan to combine them all into a 
CLI tool, but for now, this project contains just individual files with my solutions to these encryption algorithms that anyone is free to 
study or (more likely) find mistakes in and/or optimize.
